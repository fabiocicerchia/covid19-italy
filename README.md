**What's COVID-19?**

> Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
> (SARS-CoV-2). The disease was first identified in 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has spread globally, resulting in the 2019â€“20
> coronavirus pandemic. Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. Muscle pain, sputum production and sore
> throat are less common symptoms.

**How can I help prevent the spreading?**

Since the virus is quite aggressive and the contamination trends are exponential, the recommended way to prevent from
spreading even more is: **[#StayTheFuckHome](https://covid19.fabiocicerchia.it/)**.

This is not an official source so please do get informed with your local authorities in regards to what measures have
been put in place to contain the virus. More details on the

## Run web interface

```
$ php -S 127.0.0.1:8001 -t web
```

Then you can browse application on `http://127.0.0.1:8001/` (you can use a different port, if you prefer)

## CONTRIBUTE

Any contribution is very welcomed!

**NOTE:** I've tried to be as much practical as possible, without going too deep with design-patterns and best-practices.
At this stage I mainly focus on the functionalities, although I do refactor as often as possible.
